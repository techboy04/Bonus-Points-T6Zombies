# Perk Bonus Points
Hello there, I have decided to make a little code that gives you 100 bonus points when you prone near the perk machines.

This is the same mechanic that exists on future Zombies games and on Origins.

I may improve on the code in the near future to add more spice but for now, enjoy this little feature!

Credits to DoktorSAS, teh bandit, and ZECxR3ap3r for helping me out!

## Installation
Download perkbonuspoints.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using perkbonuspoints_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
